# Rockâ€“Paperâ€“Scissors Game (Console Version)

This is a basic JavaScript implementation of the classic **Rockâ€“Paperâ€“Scissors** game. The user plays against the computer, and the first to score 5 points wins the game.

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

- The computer randomly chooses between:
  - Stone
  - Paper
  - Scissor
- The user is prompted to input their choice.
- The winner of each round is determined by traditional game rules:
  - Stone beats Scissor
  - Paper beats Stone
  - Scissor beats Paper
- The game continues until **either the human or the computer reaches 5 points**.
